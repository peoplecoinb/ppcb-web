All the help given in the world is largely not measured and displayed fully and accurately. PPCB was born with the meaning of recognizing and preserving the value of that help, equal to the number of PPCB you own.

PPCB will represent you and me, as well as the global blockchain community, to join hands to contribute to eliminating global problems: health, education, religion, environment.

From there, PPCB will begin its mission with each PPCB coin having a starting value of $0.001. To represent a mine willing to help worth $50M.
